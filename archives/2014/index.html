        <p><strong>Early days</strong><br>Since I was a child I was always facinated by technology. My brother and I got our first gaming console in the early 90’s as a common Christmas present. We quickly became addicted to video games. Almost every weekend we would go to the video store, rent a few games and play in the basement until our parents would tell us it was enough and that we needed to see the sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>High School</strong><br>When I started high school my best friend introduced me to one of his friend who was a huge computer geek. He was the first person I met that knew how to use the command line of his computer. He showed us how to navigate through folders, zip files, execute programs. The goal at this time was mostly to be able to copy and install games from one computer to another. I remember his excitement when he showed us that he could write a sentence on the screen and make the computer say whatever he wrote using a robotic voice. We couldn’t help but make fun of how the computer was misprononcing his french name.</p>
<p>When came the time to choose an optional class in high school the choice was easy. Since my friends and I wanted to be in the same class and since we were already familiar with computers we all decided to do the programming class. After all the class would be that much easier if we were all there to help each other. We were also hoping to learn the basis that would allow us one day to program a game like the ones we were playing on our gaming consoles.</p>
<p>We all did pretty well in this class. Our teacher showed us how to build very basic programs using Visual Basics. We learned how to build a class, use variables to store data and use operator to create conditions. Our end-of-year project was a game where little images clouds would race across the screen. The clouds were going at different speeds based on a randomized number and would hit stop signs that were also shown randomly.</p>
<p><strong>College</strong><br>After high school I had no idea what I wanted to do for a living but I knew I loved math and that I was good at solving problems. I also knew I loved learning about new technologies and understand how the latest gadgets worked. So working in technology just sounded like a great idea. So I applied to a Computer Science undergrad and got in.</p>
<p>Those 4 years in college were an awesome experience. Even though we often had to work long hours during the night trying to complete our projects, the satisfaction we were getting from seeing the result on the screen and having built something useful was a great reward. Unlike other more conventional programs we also had a lot of opportunity to work in teams. I don’t think I would have completed the program without the help of my fellow classmate and now very good friend Frank. I think it’s one of the great thing about working as a developer. You develop very good relationship with your teammates and they push you to learn and always get better at your job.</p>
<p><strong>My first job</strong><br>After school I worked for 6 years as a web developer building ASP.NET applications for salesforce training in the pharmaceutical and financial service industries. Since it was a small company everyone had the chance to touch everything. We were building the HTML, writing the CSS and javascript, creating the database schema, writing the SQL store procedures and building the backend. The most senior engineers were also in charge of deploying the applications to production and manage existing installations.</p>
<p>In 2010 I had spent the last year learning about Silverlight. The framework developed by Microsoft was allowing to do things on the front-end like animations and video that was before only possible using Flash. I was also starting to feel that I have reached a plateau at the company I was and that it was time for me to leave if I wanted to keep progressing. So I got a job at a company that was looking for Silverlight developers.</p>
<p><strong>Agile and working with customers</strong><br>I joined the team as a Silverlight developer and spent the first year learning from the very experienced developers that were in the team. We were working on a new product that the company had decided to manage differently than their other products. They were using Scrum and had hired consultants to train us and work with us. It was refreshing to work in an environment where the team was empowered to make decisions and was encourage to work together to plan the work to be done. I also immediatly saw the difference in how the team was able to produce high quality software, release frequently and readjust the priorities based on the feedback from customers.</p>
<p>Since I was one of the few in the team that had experience deploying web applications my manager one day decided to send me to L.A. to help our integration team install the software for a demo to a potential customer. When I arrived the team was in panic because nothing was working. I manage to find the problem and got everything working just in time for the demo. My work didn’t stay unnoticed and soon I was sent to help with other demos. I started developing a deep understanding of the market and getting very comfortable presenting to potential customers. I also got very comfortable explaining the technology and our methodology to existing customers. I eventually became responsible for the integration team that was testing, deploying the software and also training new customers.</p>
<p><strong>Product management</strong><br>In 2012 my experience in a customer facing role and my deep understanding of the Agile/Scrum framework led me to a role of Product Manager in a startup company. My developer background and my communication skills were great assets to bridge the gap between the development team and the customer. For 2 years I worked as a Product Manager in different companies. I worked with the customers to define the requirements and prioritise the backlog. I worked with the design team to build wireframes and mockups and with the development team to help them organize the work to do. In the meantime I got my Scrum master certifiation and learned how to better lead the Scrum meetings.</p>
<p><strong>What now?</strong><br>I recently got married and moved to New York to be with my wife. The last 2 years working with startups introduced me to web development on open source technologies like Linux and the concept of single page application. I strongly believe that Javascript is a powerful language that is there to stay and grow in the market and that open-source technologies will only become more popular. I also think that it is an amazing advantage for a company to use the same language across their stack of technologies, something that Node.js now allows. For that reason I want to build an expertise in Javascipt. I always enjoyed coding and would be very happy being a developer for the rest of my career but even if I decide to go back to product management I think being a great Javascript developer will be an asset and will give me credibilty in front of any development team.</p>
<p>So here I am FullStack Academy!</p>
